# Favorite Artists

## Instructions

**Please read this entire README to make sure you understand what is expected of you before you begin.**

This sprint challenge is designed to ensure that you are competent with the concepts taught throughout Objective-C Part 1.

1. Begin by forking this repository. Clone your forked repository to your machine. 
2. There is no starter project. Create a project for this challenge in this repository and commit as appropriate while you work. 
3. Push your final project to GitHub, then create a pull request back to this original repository.

**You will have 3 hours to complete this sprint challenge**

If you have any questions about the project requirements or expectations, ask your PM or instructor. Good luck!

## Screen Recording

Please view the screen recordings so you will know what your finished project should look like:

## Before you begin

You will be using is [The Audio DB Website](https://theaudiodb.com) to get information about an artist that the user searches for. The API's documentation is [here](https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php).

**NOTE:** In the place of an actual API key, use the number `1` instead. This is the API's demo key.

A sample request for *Macklemore* looks like this URL and JSON response (a request may take a few seconds to complete):

[https://theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/1/searchalbum.php?s=Macklemore](https://theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/1/searchalbum.php?s=Macklemore)

## Requirements

The requirements for this project are as follows:

1. A model object that represents an artist. It should have the following properties:
    - Their name.
    - Their biography.
    - The year that they formed. **This must be a primitive.**
2. A category called `NSJSONSerialization`. In this category add:
    - An initializer to create your model object from a dictionary.
        
        `- (void)initWithDictionary:(NSDictionary *)`
        
    - A function that returns your model object in dictionary form.
        
        `- (NSDictionary *)toDictionary`
        
3. Add the ability to save a searched artist. 
    - Implement persistence using `NSFileManager` to save your model objects to a file in the application's Document directory. 
    - **Note:** As you do not have access to `Codable` use `NSJSONSerialization` to help turn your model objects into `NSData`.
4. A table view controller that displays a list of saved artists.
5. A detail view controller that allows the user to search for new artists, and also view saved artist information.

## Go Further

* Persist your model objects using Core Data instead of saving them to a file.
* Download album or artist artwork and present these images in the table view cell and/or the detail view.
* Persist album/artist artwork in a [temporary directory](https://nshipster.com/temporary-files/).
* Allow the user to remove saved artists from the table view.
